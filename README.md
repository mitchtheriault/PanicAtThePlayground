Panic at the Playground is an experimental project in which I tasked generative AI with developing a "viral" game. ChatGPT came up with the concept, scripted the gameplay, and prompted the generation of 3D models, textures, and sounds for the game. I tried to interviene as little as possible, instead acting as a medium between the AI tools and the game engine.

Here's a video that covers its creation:
